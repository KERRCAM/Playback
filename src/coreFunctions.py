    WHERE TO PUT SEARCH SORT ALGORITHMS

    Need to prioritise good run times and efficiency here as we are dealing with
    potentially tens of thousands of items needing sorted and hundreds of thousends
    needing to be searched through.

    So go more quick sorts, merge sorts and binary searches etc - best option in each case.
    Things like bubble sort and linear searches will be no good.

    ^ Can replace doc string once code is in, above is just a note.
