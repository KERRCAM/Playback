GIT terminal commands
Getting the repo on your machine - easier to do without git commands,
just grab the repo url on github and select clone git repo when you open
a new vs code window (or other code editor) then paste in the url, NOTE: this will
put you straight on master branch which should NOT be edited, before doing any
coding you should make a new branch or switch to an existing one.

git pull
gets info on new branches and updates current branch if there is changes
 (should be used if multiple people are working on same branch or if you are switching branch)

git add -A
adds all uncommitted files with differences to the next commit
(stages them) (replace -A with file path for specific file)

git commit -a -m ""
commits all staged changes, put commit is message in the quotes
(what you have done) (again replace -a with path for specific file)

git push
pushes all local commits to the branch you are working on
(Note: First time you commit to a branch you HAVE to do
git push -u origin newBranchName, after that just git push is fine)

NOTE: not a typo it is -A for add and -a for commit

git branch X
makes new branch named X
(note: doesn't automatically switch to this new branch)

git checkout X
switches to branch X
(can also make a new branch with this by doing git checkout -b X)

git status
shows what files have uncommitted changes and files that
have been committed not pushed - also shows if everything is up to date

Various other git commands that may be helpful like different git diff
commands but likely the above should be fine to cover everything you need.
